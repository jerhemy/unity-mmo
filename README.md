# Unity MMO
This is more of a passion project to create a framework for creating a MMO in Unity. A lot of the priciples I'm taking are from the Original Everquest. The server is completely separate and written in .NET Core 2.2 using UDP sockets which is meant to be ran separatly from Unity itself to allow the best portability.
